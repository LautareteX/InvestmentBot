# Investment Bot 0.0.1

This BOT checks cheque investment options in Uruguay.

As a "cheque" investor, I decided to create a tool that help me in my day to day life, today I share it with you, and tell you a little bit about the future.

It is currently in its most basic version, only checking for new opportunities regardless of type or content. In the future you will be able to choose what type of "cheques" you want to be alerted about, and get the information about it through communication channels.
